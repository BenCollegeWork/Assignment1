                I'm Benjamin, a Software Engineering Co-op student at Centennial College. I am aspiring to become 
                a full-stack developer but have interests in other programming fields such as databases and game 
                development. My goal will always be to create client-first applications that are user-friendly and accessible to all. 
                I am excited to be on this journey and eager to learn and grow as a developer.
